        <h1>THIS WEBSITE HAS BEEN SEIZED</h1>
        <p>
            As part of Operation SweatyBalls, this domain has been seized under authority of Title 69, S.U.K.M.I. Code Section 420.  
            <br><br>
            This site has been taken offline by absolutely nobody, because frankly, no one gave a f**k. Instead of endlessly liking posts on LinkedIn or mindlessly scrolling Reddit, consider actually making a difference. Report threats, protect people, and stay alert. Remember, it only takes one person to stop damage â€“ not just avoiding phishing links, but also responsibly reporting them.
        </p>
        <div class="legal">
           To the brilliant masterminds behind this: congrats on getting caught running a phishing site held together with duct tape and a beacon so obvious even McAfee flagged it. This seizure was carried out by NOGAF (No One Gives A Fuck) in coordination with absolutely no one else.
